### Configuration and Sending Emails

```typescript
import { MailService } from "@hedhog/mail";
import { Mail } from "@hedhog/mail/interfaces/mail.interface";

// Assuming you have properly configured MailService in your module

const mailService = new MailService(/* configuration options */);

const mail: Mail = {
  from: "sender@example.com",
  to: "recipient@example.com",
  subject: "Test Email",
  body: "<h1>Hello World!</h1>",
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: "attachment.txt",
      content: Buffer.from("Hello, this is an attachment!"),
      contentType: "text/plain",
    },
  ],
};

mailService
  .send(mail)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log("Email sent successfully:", response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error sending email:", error);
  });
```

## Available Methods

- **send(mail: Mail)**: Sends an email based on the specified configuration (AWS, GMAIL, or SMTP).
